Objective is to identify what characterizes clean-economy jobs

3 files:
      1. Linkedin_job_postings.csv: this is the main dataset, it contains information on job postings
      including job title, location, company, etc.
      2. Job_Summary.csv: a dataset with job descriptions
      3. Job_skills.csv: a dataset with skills required for the job

Task 1: Suggest an approach to identify “clean-economy jobs” (note that there is not a unique definition of what a clean-economy job is, so feel free to come up with your own)

Task 2: Compare clean and non-clean jobs along at least one dimension, for example:
- Are clean-economy jobs concentrated in specific sectors or countries?
- Do clean-economy jobs differ in the skills of educational qualifications they require?
