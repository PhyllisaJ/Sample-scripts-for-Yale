Objective is to identify what characterizes clean-economy jobs

Uses 3 datasets:
- Linkedin_job_postings.csv: this is the main dataset, it contains information on job postings including job title, location, company, etc.
- Job_Summary.csv: a dataset with job descriptions
- Job_skills.csv: a dataset with skills required for the job

Part 1: An approach to identify "clean-economy jobs" (note that there is not a unique definition of what a clean-economy job is, so feel free to come up with your own)

Part 2: Compare clean and non-clean jobs along at least one dimension, for example:
- Are clean-economy jobs concentrated in specific sectors or countries?
- Do clean-economy jobs differ in the number of skills or educational qualifications they require?

Impact of group therapy sessions on depression:

3 datasets:
- Demographics. This dataset includes treatment assignment at the household level and demographic information for each member in the sampled households.
- Assets. This dataset includes the quantity and monetary value of assets owned by the household, under three categories of assets: Animals, Tools, and Durable Goods.-
-  Depression information. This dataset includes information for the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale collected for household heads and their spouses.
      
Part 1 involves cleaning 3 datasets and creating a single dataset with the necessary information for analysis

Part 2 
- Exploratory analysis using wave 1, relationship between depression and household wealth, proxied by total asset value, relationship between depression and gender and relationship between depression and having a partner.
- Evaluating the RCT using wave 2, the impact of group therapy sessions on depression, evaluating heterogeneous treatment effect based on gender, and creating publishable tables.
